#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
its importance is that it has helped by impoving the user experience for applications, encourages innovation as people solve different world problems and has encouraged collaboration by coding collaboratively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1960 -1970, researchers and practitioners began to develop formal methods for software design and development, such as structured programming.
In the following decades,the introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s led to a shift in how software was designed and developed.
The 1990s saw the emergence of the Agile software development methodologies, which emphasized flexibility and responsiveness to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1: Planning and Requirement Analysis-The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project.
2: Defining Requirements-all the requirements for the target software are specified.
3: Designing Architecture-The software engineers come up with an achitecture for the software to be created.
4: Developing Product-the fundamental development of the product starts.
5: Product Testing and Integration-testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution.
6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products-After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the 
   organizationâ€™s strategy.   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a sequential software development methodology where progress flows in a linear while agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-The developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product.They are involved in developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Quality assuarance trainer-Creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed.They create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. 
Project manager-The roles of the project manager may include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products.They create the blueprint for the project, including the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines and laying out communication strategies.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDE is designed to simplify software development and can identify and minimize coding mistakes and typos e.g Visual Studios while VCS facilitates collaboration and version tracking, ensuring code integrity and allowing easy rollback e.g git version control system. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity: Software systems have become increasingly complex, making it difficult for developers to understand and manage all the components of a system.The remedy is to use design patterns and architecture principles to simplify the software systems and make it easy to understand and manage.
Maintaining Quality: Ensuring the quality of software systems can be a challenging task, as developers need to account for various factors such as performance, security, and usability.The remedy is to use software testing and quality assurance techniques to ensure the quality of software systems, and conduct code reviews to identify and fix issues early on.
Meeting Deadlines: Developers often work under tight deadlines, which can make it difficult to ensure the quality of the final product.The remedy is to use project management techniques such as Agile development and Scrum to plan and manage work effectively.
Keeping up with new technologies: Software development is a rapidly evolving field, and developers must constantly learn new technologies and programming languages to stay current.The remedy is to continuously learn and explore new technologies and programming languages to stay current.
Managing changing requirements: Software development projects often involve working with changing requirements, which can make it difficult for developers to plan and manage their work effectively.The remedy is to use flexible development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum to handle changing requirements effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:
This focuses on testing individual units or components of code in isolation to verify that each part operates correctly on its own. 
Integration Testing:
This ensures that different parts of a software application work seamlessly when combined, focusing on detecting and resolving issues that arise from the interactions between modules or subsystems. 
System Testing:
This evaluates the software application's behavior in various scenarios and under different conditions, including normal and abnormal usage, to ensure that it can handle different situations effectively. 
Acceptance Testing:
This type of testing is done to determine if a feature or system meets the customer expectations and requirements, ensuring the product is ready for delivery and meets end-user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the process of crafting instructions (prompts) to elicit the best possible output from a generative AI model.
Its importance:
1.Better user experience: Users get relevant responses without having to try multiple prompts 
2.More accurate results: Prompts help AI models understand the intent of a query and produce more accurate responses 
3.Increased flexibility: Prompts can be reused across an organization to create more flexible tools 
4.Reduced manual review: Prompts can help reduce the need for manual review and editing 
5.Improved efficiency: Prompts can help make AI applications more efficient and effective 
6.Mitigated bias: Prompts can help mitigate bias that may be present in the AI's training data 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Explain software engineering
Improved: List and explain software engineering as used in the technology industry.

The improved prompt is direct to my needs and covers a specific part unlike the vague prompt which goes to generalization and not specific.
