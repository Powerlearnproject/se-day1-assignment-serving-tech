Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
its importance is that it has helped by impoving the user experience for applications, encourages innovation as people solve different world problems and has encouraged collaboration by coding collaboratively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1960 -1970, researchers and practitioners began to develop formal methods for software design and development, such as structured programming.
In the following decades,the introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s led to a shift in how software was designed and developed.
The 1990s saw the emergence of the Agile software development methodologies, which emphasized flexibility and responsiveness to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1: Planning and Requirement Analysis-The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project.
2: Defining Requirements-all the requirements for the target software are specified.
3: Designing Architecture-The software engineers come up with an achitecture for the software to be created.
4: Developing Product-the fundamental development of the product starts.
5: Product Testing and Integration-testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution.
6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products-After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the 
   organizationâ€™s strategy.   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a sequential software development methodology where progress flows in a linear while agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
